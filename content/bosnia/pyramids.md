I've come a long way since Bosnia, but didn't had the time or the will to write
some stuff, so although I'm currently in Taiwan, I will look back a bit on the
mysterious Bosnians pyramids.

Here's how I heard about it, back when I was in Serbia :

- (Fellow backpacker) Where are you going next ?
- (me) Sarajevo !
- Oh nice, I've just come back from there, I love that city !
- I'm looking forward to be there, for sure.
- Do you know that they have real pyramids there ?
- Pyramids ? Shit ! Gotta have a look !

So yeah, in the middle of Europe, I was going to sightsee some pyramids.

From Sarajevo, I took a bus to Visoko, the New-Gizeh of Europe.
In this small town, a few signs leaded me to the several spots related to the
pyramids.
Noticing one big hill in front of me, which I then learn to be the newly called Sun pyramid, I
began to climb it to get a overall picture of what it was all about.

Halfway to the top, some large panel started to feed me about the pyramids.
I was, according to it, climbing the tallest and oldest pyramid on earth.
So, a few minutes latter, I was standing on the tallest pyramid on earth. How
cool that was !  
But no sign of man made rocks, just a few stones popping out of the hill, and
some medieval ruins at the top.  
Willing to know more about it, I then went to another place where I was going
to find strange tunnels. There, a guide provide me some insight about the whole
thing. We walked trough small tunnels for several meters, and here's what I've
been told :
- Some tests suggested that these tunnels have been build for the first time
  before the Sumerian, which is currently accepted as the first civilization to
  ever existed.
- The sun pyramids is more precise than the Kheops one, north-facing speaking.
- The shadow of the "sun" pyramid cover exactly the "Moon" pyramid once a year.
