This story begins a first of April. True story though, but the irony of the date
is enjoyable.  
Actually no, it begins a couple day before. Here we are, Ho Chi Minh. This day
was my last in Vietnam, as my visa would expire the day after. I had just
leaved a group of fellow backpackers I spend time with from Phong Nah to Hoi
An. Alone again, I jumped in the bus who would take me to Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  
I knew they would ask me to pay 35 bucks for my visa at the border, when it
should have been only 30. I had planned not to play the game of corruption, and
when the driver ask the bunch of foreigner from the bus the 35, here I stand,
claiming that I won't let that happen. With the consent of the backpacker team,
30 it will be, even if we have to wait one hour at the border.  
Meanwhile the bus broke down, forcing us to wait for another one in the middle
of the highway, but our determination was still intact. Until the driver hand
me this mad Vietnamese lady on the phone, who made clear that if we wanted to
pay 30 bucks, they will do whatever would be possible to make it painful.
Meaning paying night time fee at the border, waiting one hour, and using bikes to catch the bus,
who won't be waiting for us but five miles from the border.  
We had the choice of eventually paying the same price in both case, so it was
just a matter of loosing either time or self-esteem.  
We crossed the border in ten minutes.  

Arriving in Phnom Penh, I headed to my booked hostel, with Angèle, nerdy French
girl, with who I would've probably not talk to if it wasn't for all our bus troubles.  
She didn't knew where to sleep so I was happy to lead her to the hostel, as well
as making a new friend before even setting foot in Cambodia.  

The next few days, still strained by the aborted revolution from the bus earlier, I was
willing to forget about making any plan for a while, letting Angèle and her
strong and effective leadership driving me around.  

Not that I don't feel bad about letting other people do all the searching and
planning job though. This is more like letting randomness - in that case other
people decisions - choose my path. Maybe I should use dices in the future, as
Raven and Lief would do... Oh wait, we are not there yet.  

So, chilling by the swimming pool in Phnom Penh - 6$ Hostel have swimming pool
there, why not - Angèle start speaking about her American friend doing a
work-away in Kampot, south of Cambodia, and that we could met her there as
there's many thing to see. Still not willing to make any big decision of my own for a while,
I accept to take the bus to this funny named city - Funny if you're French.
Otherwise it's not, sorry for you guys.  

Kampot here I am, with Angèle and another solo backpacker named Kareen, who
will unfortunately be forced to leave us after she got quite sick from the traitorous
sun of Cambodia.  
No much time to unpack our stuff, we are already late to dinner with this
mysterious friend of Angèle.  

At the meeting point, we saw this Californian girl running toward us and giving
a big hug to her friend Angèle. Pretty girl, I said to myself.  

You should know that my confidence with girl is quite low. When someone else,
when meting a girl he's interested to, would start making some moves, I would
take a step back, stay passive and hoping to build a good friendship with this
person. Something like *way out of my league* would cross my mind in such
context. Reality sometimes prove me wrong, showing me that I have a lot to learn
about people.  

Madison is her name. A 27 years old numeric nomad, working in PR, in love with
travels and peoples. She would ask you these deep questions, trying to get
inside your brain even if she's just met you. I love that, since I wouldn't
dare myself to be so intimate with people I barely knew. All about balance, and
learning. I'm not attracted to people who behave and think like me, as I have nothing to
give them, and nothing to gain from them. So here I am, playing this game of
sharing personal thoughts and experiences as we enjoy our dinner in Kampot.  

Our stay in this small but charming city went on, between paddle boarding,
bikes trip to the mountain, local food and a couple beers. I liked the group I
was with, Angèle, Lauren, other passing-by faces, and Madison. I was happy,
eventually leaving this place with Angèle for the beaches and island of
Sihanoukville, when I heard that Maddie would join us a couple days after. I
wanted to share more with her, as I was feeling more comfortable with that girl than
I usually am with others. Was still thinking about real, true friendship though,
mistrusting myself after few past failure that shook my confidence.  

Sun, beaches. I was still letting myself driven by the waves of
surrounding friend. That's how I got drunk with people worth to meet, resulting in
beer-pong games, dancing and midnight swimming.  

The next morning, hangover, we would take a early - too early - boat to Koh Rong Sanloem,
heavenly island where we would enjoy a night in a cozy bungalow by the sea.  
As you said to me latter, Maddie, I was completely missing the signals you would sent me at that time,
and I now feel a bit lame about that. We were starting to know each other
better, and to my own surprise I was willing to open myself to some of the most
personal episode of my life.  

Angèle, Maddie and me were now ready to go north, and after a short stay at
Battambank, the city of the five million bats, with vivid memories of our trip
in the Battuktuk, we reached the city of Siem Reap, were we would stay a couple
of days, and were this story really begins and comes to an end.  

It's getting harder for me to find the right word to tell this adventure,
with my way too basic English and my ability of not quite grasping the meaning of my
own thoughts. Anyway, nobody should read this but you.

This is that night, during the early hours of the first of April,
when I was showing off with my arguably passable pool skills, that,
after bringing me several beers and making sure I would be trap alone with you,
you dare me to kiss you.  
I think Alcohol excused a lot of over thinking and helped me to act as you dare
me to do quickly enough. If I wouldn't have been that drunk, my brain would have
done a back flip trying to figure out how we had come to this. I like to
tell myself that I would have still kissed you.  

On this first of April, I had been fooled by you. I, who thought someone like
you would never be that interested in someone like me, had been proved wrong.  

You already did a pretty good job at doing a summary of memorable moments spent
together, I won't relate them for they belong to us. And to that monk.
And these guys behind the fence. Still trying to forget them. Whatever.  

I have some regrets, not having being able to start this connection sooner, not
responding every time you would ask me what I was thinking. Not using enough
word of affirmation on you also, because I had plenty of those.  

You're beautiful, with this big Chicago smile, these deep blue eyes and... Well
ok, your hair cut could be better, but you aren't the one to blame. Even more
importantly, you bring joy to people around you, you challenge them in a good
way without judging them too quickly, you're one of this human you rarely meet
with whom you just want to keep talking or just listening to. You're a free
smart mind making it's own way into this messy world.  
You made me comfortable. You know that I haven't been with someone for a while,
and maybe if this random journey would have taken me to another woman, I
wouldn't have kissed her. You were exactly the person I needed, and I'm
thankful just to even met someone like you.  

I hope we helped each other and that we are both emerging strengthened of this
improbable adventure.  

I definitely hope to see you again, regardless of the circumstances.  

You were a humongous smilestone - pun intended - in this physical and mental journey in foreign land.
