### Hi !

Hi !

### Who are you ?

Pierre, 23 years old, French.

### And why interviewing yourself, which is kind of odd ?

To introduce people to this blog, which will talk about my trip around the
world-ish.

### Oh, travel, I love travel. Tell me more.

There a thousand reasons one should travel that have already been told by all
backpackers around the world.  
As for me, I want to extend my comfort zone, see the world differently, and
find what I really want to do with this god damned life of mine.

### Where then ?

South.
From France to Greece, then a plane to Japan, and from there all down to New
Zealand.
Between these markers, we'll see day by day.

### What will be on this blog ?

Maybe nothing, maybe stories and photos.

### Can I click on the top earth logo ?

Yes. ( Work in progress )
