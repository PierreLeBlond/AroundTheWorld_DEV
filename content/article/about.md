### Hi !

Hi !

### Who are you ?

Pierre, 23 years old, French.

### And why interviewing yourself, which is kind of odd ?

To introduce people to this blog, which will talk about my trip around the
world-ish.

### Oh, travel, I love travel. Tell me more.

There a thousand reasons one should travel that have already been told by all
backpackers around the world, so we'll get directly to my own reasons.  
I've just finished my studies, everything went fine so far, I don't have to
struggle much to find a job, and society is ready to welcome me.  
But, well, I'm not ready, or should I say I don't want to be part of something
I still don't understand.  
I thing I'm too afraid of being stuck in a routine, in a scheme most people
follow, even if I find a great job and I keep a open mind.  
More than a run away, travelling seems to be the way of knowing more about how
people behave and interact with each others, outside the structure I've been into since my
childhood.  

### Where then ?

South.
From France to Greece, then a plane to Japan, and from there all down to New
Zealand.
Between these marker, we'll see day by day.

### What will be on this blog ?

Maybe nothing, maybe stories and photos.

### Can I click on the top earth logo ?

Yes. ( Work in progress )
