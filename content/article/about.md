### Hi !

Hi !

### Who are you ?

Pierre, 23 years old, French, just got my master degree.

### And why interviewing yourself, which is kind of odd ?

To introduce people to this blog, which will talk about my trip around the
world-ish.

### Oh, travel, I love travel. Tell me more.

Hum, I've finished my studies, I've saved some money, I've got time.
Plus, I don't know quite yet what I want to spend my life on, so taking a one
year break suit me.
Add to that all the reasons one should travel that have already been said a
thousand time.

### Where then ?

South.
From France to Greece, then a plane to Japan, and from there all down to New
Zealand.
Between these marker, we'll see day by day.

### What will be on this blog ?

Maybe nothing, maybe stories and photos.

### Can I click on the top earth logo ?

Yes.
