Here's what I will be carrying along :

* A short, a jean and their devil child, a hybrid short/jean.
* Three T-shirt
* Five underpants
* Five socks
* A coat and a sweater
* Walking shoe and street shoe
* Sunglasses
* Swimsuit
* Towel
* Silk bag (To sleep)
* Gourd
* Toilet kit
* Secret pocket, to put money and ID
* Sketch book
* Knife
* Small laptop

Adding the bag, we're reaching 10 kg, which is fine !
The bag can contain 50L, so there's some place left even when all the gears are
in it.  
I could have bought a smaller bag, and take less or lighter stuff, but it would
have asked too much thinking process.
