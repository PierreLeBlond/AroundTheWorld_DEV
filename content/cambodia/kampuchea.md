\- "Tuktuk Sir ?"  

That's probably the first thing you will hear when you'll make the first step
on the Kingdom of Cambodia. You'd better get use to it !  
If you were used to crowded streets in Saigon or other major cities in Vietnam,
people honking all the time for no reason but entertainment, you'll find Phnom Penh, the
capital of Cambodia, much more quiet. Streets are larger and fewer bikes and
cars use them, barely honking. It's like they overestimated the number of citizens,
or probably anticipating the years to come. I did got the feeling that Cambodia
is a country which is rebuilding itself. From what, should you ask. Well here's
another country among too many who endured dictatorship and mass murdering.  

The name *Khmer Rouges* means, for Khmer people, being forced to
leave the city, hard working, suffering, losing family or friend, being lost by
family or friend, being tortured, death.  
Polpot and his *Khmer Rouges* destroyed the country for love of communism
ideology, and fear of being spied and overthrew.  

Healing it's wounds, the country is developing itself at high speed.  
New buildings, office are under construction everywhere in the cities, and
resorts and casinos popping along the coast.  
Tourism is growing, the country and its inhabitants adapting themselves to
the increasing number of tourists.  

Now, it's hard to rightly compare different countries and speak about them
when you've only seen a glimpse of how their inhabitants struggle with live and how they feel.
You should therefor take my stories as a sketch of the reality there, twisted
by a foreigner's look.  

\- "Hello ! Hello, hello, hello !"  

Here's one of the numerous kids you'll see waving at you, big smile on their face.  
Bob, old stager when it comes to traveling, behind his huge beard, would tell you that fifty per cent
of the population is under 20 years old. Only 3 or 5 per cent above 60.  
On one side, a lot of young adult, result of a baby boom post *Khmer Rouges*.
Tuktuk drivers, restaurant owners, they all have a large family to feed, and
if they are glad not to have endured the horror of the past, they are still having a
grudge against the government, which remains the same since 1997. Through rigged
elections, these Cambodian rulers do not seem to met people expectation regarding
wages and living condition. Apparently thing could change next year, as the
election will be overseen by an NGO, according to this Tuktuk driver from
Bantambank, sharing his story, a tear in the eye.  

Let's come back to these kids now. Some will just want to play with you and
practice their English, meaning their family is doing well. Some, although
friendly, will try to get some money from you. And here you are, struggling to
find out if giving them something will help them attends school, or if their
parents will keep the earnings for themselves.

That's with mixed feelings that you could spend hours playing with local
children on a beach in Sihanoukville, while dreaming up what this country could
be in 20 years.  

Picture this.  
What will all these kids, better English speaker than their parents, wishing brighter
futures, at the border between two separate culture, do when they'll become in
age to rule the country ?  
Wouldn't it be something to see all these smart-ass boys and girls, owning a
country which has still many thing to offer in terms of culture, history and nature
despite the scares of war, bombing and dictatorship.  

Perhaps will it just become an other copy of these new developed countries, an other
touristic attraction in this amusement park called earth.  
Or perhaps when you'll come back there in twenty years, these same kids will
welcome you to their family as a wanderer traveling in a country not entirely
shaped for your exotic entertainment. A country owned by it's inhabitants,
who doesn't care about the expectation of this rich strangers, willing to prove
to the world that his two weeks vacation in Cambodia were far better than the
one his coworker spent in a surrounding country.
