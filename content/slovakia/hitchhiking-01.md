Bratislava is one hour from Vienna, so it was the perfect time to try
hitchicking.  
I thing I've always been afraid of getting stuck somewere in the
middle of a foreign country, and that's why I only used buses so far, but now
is the time to try something new.  

I'v never done hitchhicking before, and didn't knew were to start. Fortunatly,
we live in a great century and the World Wild Web has an answer for you.  
A few researches, and I found the [golden mine](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page). 
As a wiki, many places are very well documented and you're able to know exactly
were to stand or ask for drivers depending on were you want to go.  

So I wanted to be in Bratislava in the evening, and I start walking to the
right hitchhicking spot around noon. I didn't knew how many time it would take to
find a car heading to Bratislava, so I give myself plenty of time.  
The spot was a petrol station. Once there, I saw a Slovakian car plate, I
waited for the owner to go out of the store and I simply asked if he was
going to Bratislava and if he could take me there. And he did. One hour latter
I was in Bratislava.

Actually, it was the first time this driver took someone hitchhicking.  
So, thumbs up, and don't panic !
